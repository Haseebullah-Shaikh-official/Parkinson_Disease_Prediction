# Diagnosing_Parkinson_Disease
Data science plays a crucial role in the field of medical research. The movement 
disorder of nervous system known as Parkisonâ€™s disease (PD) affects millions globally. 
Unfortunately, there is no effective and confirmed method by which PD can be cured. 
However, there are some non-invasive techniques which can be used for diagnosing
PD at some extent. In this project, we have used data science process which includes 
data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), descriptive and inferential statistical 
techniques, feature selection and regression modeling to better understand PD and 
identify at which extent PD can be diagnosed using speech data. 
We have two primary objectives in this project. The first objective involves identifying 
features that can be used to distinguish between people with PD (PPD) and non-PPD
group. For this objective, we have used the given first dataset which contains speech
data collected from voice samples of 40 individuals, 20 PPD and 20 non-PPD group.
The second objective involves predicting total and motor UPDRS score which is 
assigned to PPD group by physician based on medical examination. We have used the 
given second dataset which contains speech data collected from voice samples of 42 
individuals with PD only.

The indetail report is also written which explains the overall analysis methodology. The report is confidential.
